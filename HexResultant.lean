The `HexResultant` library provides the fraction-free polynomial primitives
used to compute subresultant pseudo-remainder sequences, resultants, and
discriminants over exact coefficient rings. Its initial executable surface is
polynomial pseudo-division over `Hex.DensePoly`, with the computational
dependency surface kept at `HexPoly` plus the shared exact-division contract
in `HexBasic.ExactDiv`. Brown's nonzero PRS chain tracks
its corrected terminal principal-subresultant scalar separately, so defective
degree drops retain the exact resultant scale without matrix construction.
The standard discriminant is computed from the signed resultant with the
formal derivative and an exact leading-coefficient quotient.

Correctness and correspondence with Mathlib's `Polynomial.resultant` and
`Polynomial.discr` live in the companion `HexResultantMathlib` library.
