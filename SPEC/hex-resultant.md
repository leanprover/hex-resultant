# hex-resultant (subresultant chain, depends on hex-poly, hex-basic, hex-determinant)

Polynomial resultant and discriminant for `Hex.DensePoly R` over a
commutative exact-division domain. Computed via the **subresultant
pseudo-remainder sequence** (Collins 1967; Brown 1978), the standard
fraction-free algorithm.

The main instantiations are `R = Int` (that is, `ZPoly`), `R = ZPoly`
for bivariate elimination, and `R = NumberTower.Elem T` for norms over
successive number-field extensions. The last consumer lives in
`hex-number-field-tower`; this library remains independent of it.

## Why subresultants, not Sylvester+Bareiss

A naive implementation could form the `(n+m) × (n+m)` Sylvester matrix
and take its Bareiss determinant. That costs `O((n+m)³)` coefficient
operations. The subresultant chain reaches the same value in at most
`min(n, m) + 1` pseudo-division calls, `O(n·m)` coefficient operations
total. Intermediate coefficients in both algorithms are (up to sign)
minors of the Sylvester matrix, so both have the same well-controlled
coefficient growth: bit-length `O((n+m) · (log(n+m) + log ‖f‖∞ +
log ‖g‖∞))` over `R = Int`. The saving is the operation count, a
factor of roughly `n+m`.

It also keeps the dependency surface minimal. The algorithm is
iterated polynomial pseudo-division plus scale-factor bookkeeping.
Pseudo-division stays inside `R` and is defined in this library
(`HexPoly` has only Euclidean division, which needs `Div` on the
coefficients). Exact scalar quotients reuse that `Div` operation behind
the law package below. No matrix dependency, depth 1.

```

The executable definitions require only the operations they call: in
particular `[Div R]`, but not `ExactDivLaws R`. Correctness theorems require
`Lean.Grind.CommRing R`, decidable equality, and `ExactDivLaws R`. The law
implies nonzero-product and right-cancellation facts by applying `/ b` to an
equality with `b ≠ 0`.

`Int` supplies the law via `Int.mul_ediv_cancel`. There is a recursive
instance for `DensePoly R` whenever `R` has the law, so `ZPoly = DensePoly
Int` supports bivariate elimination, including nonunit constant and nonmonic
polynomial divisors. `NumberTower.Elem T` uses its existing `/`; its Mathlib
adjunct supplies the law through its scoped field instance. The tower's
computational core therefore remains law-free.

## Exact-division totality

`exactDiv a 0 = 0`. For nonzero denominators it is definitionally `a / b`;
`ExactDivLaws.mul_div_cancel_right` is the only quotient law used by the
correctness development. `divExp` and `divScalar` inherit the same zero branch.
A valid Brown run proves every denominator nonzero and every quotient exact.
On an invalid coefficient implementation or unreachable junk state, the
executable value remains deterministic but carries no algebraic claim.

## Certified pseudo-remainder algebra

For an ordered nonzero pair, reconstruction together with the strict
remainder-size bound uniquely determines `pseudoDivMod`. The public
`pseudoDivMod_unique` theorem packages that characterization; it lets the
correctness development reason from the algebraic contract instead of the
array folds implementing the quotient and remainder.

The same API proves the two homogeneity laws used in polynomial remainder
sequence arguments. For nonzero `a` and an ordered nonzero pair
(`g ≠ 0`, `g.size ≤ f.size`), if `d = f.size - g.size + 1`, then

```text
pseudoDivMod (a·f) g = (a·q, a·r)
pseudoDivMod f (a·g) = (a^(d-1)·q, a^d·r)
```

where `(q,r) = pseudoDivMod f g`. Nonzero scaling preserves dense size and
leading coefficients scale by `a`; those facts are exposed separately as
`size_scale` and `leadingCoeff_scale` under `[Div S] [ExactDivLaws S]`, whose
no-zero-divisor consequence is exactly what makes size preservation valid.

In the Mathlib adjunct, `PseudoDivMod.resultant_step` transports one reconstructed
pseudo-division step through the formal-degree Sylvester determinant. It
combines scalar homogeneity, the resultant row operation, and the swap sign.
This is the value recurrence needed by Brown correctness. It deliberately does
not claim the later coefficientwise exact divisions: their integrality is the
separate Brown--Traub subresultant theorem recorded by `BrownLaw`.
In particular, reversing `divScalar` by scaling requires the coefficientwise
exactness certified by that law; the homogeneity API does not assume it.

## Integral Brown--Traub proof bridge

The Brown--Traub correctness proof stays in the coefficient ring. Its state
invariant keeps every accumulated leading-coefficient and Brown-scale factor
cross-multiplied, so no fraction representative and no divisibility hypothesis
beyond `ExactDivLaws` is needed. A nonzero Brown input supplies `1 ≠ 0`;
`ExactDivLaws` supplies cancellation, rules out zero products, and reverses an
exact scalar multiple after its factorization has been proved.

The generalized Sylvester constructions in this proof are local,
coefficient-indexed proof objects with their finite-sum identities developed
inside `hex-resultant`; they are not matrices from `hex-matrix`. The
executable resultant and discriminant path never leaves this library.

The cofactor development behind the extended chain does reach for
`hex-determinant`: `SubresultantMinor.toMatrix` regards a local square
coefficient family as a `Hex.Matrix` so the kernel row-transport argument
can use `Matrix.det` and `Matrix.adjugate` rather than redevelop them.
`hex-determinant` is therefore a proof-side dependency of this library and
is recorded as such in `libraries.yml`.

Concretely, `DensePoly.Subresultant.coeffMatrixAt` is a finite scalar
coefficient family at explicit formal degrees, and
`DensePoly.Subresultant.coeffMinor` takes its local first-row Laplace
determinant. `DensePoly.Subresultant.poly J f g` assembles the coefficient
minors for indices `0, …, J`, so its dense degree is at most `J`.  Keeping the
formal degrees explicit in the matrix core avoids dependent casts when the
coefficient ring changes.  The construction is total through truncated
natural subtraction; Brown identities use the meaningful range
`J ≤ min (formalDegree f) (formalDegree g)`. The proof route derives the
needed multilinearity, adjacent swaps, arbitrary duplicate-column vanishing,
adjacent-transposition sequence parity, column updates, and block identities
locally from the Laplace recursion rather than importing the matrix or
determinant libraries. The theorems `coeffMinor_map`, `poly_map`, and
`exists_coeff` prove that coefficient embedding commutes with the construction
and that every mapped minor coefficient has a base-ring image witness.
The theorems `poly_scale_left` and `poly_scale_right` establish the first
Brown--Traub transformation law: scaling an input contributes one scalar for
each column in that input's generalized Sylvester block. The concrete
`rotateBlocks` transformation moves two consecutive coefficient blocks using
adjacent swaps and proves the determinant factor
`(-1)^(left * right)`. Applied to the generalized Sylvester family,
`poly_swap` gives
`S_J(f, g) = (-1)^((deg f - J) * (deg g - J)) S_J(g, f)` without importing a
matrix or determinant library.

The next Brown--Traub transformation is also internal to this local
determinant. `SubresultantMinor.productCols` realizes the required unit
upper-triangular operation by adding multiplier-weighted `G` columns to the
later `F` columns; all sources stay strictly to the left of the destination
block, and `det_productCols` proves determinant preservation. For
`H = F + B * G` with `deg F = deg B + deg G`, `productCols_addMul` identifies
the transformed swapped matrix with the existing
`coeffMatrixAt (deg G) (deg F) J l G H`. Its explicit second formal degree keeps
`F`'s degree even when `H` drops. The coefficient identity `coeffFold_eq_mul`
includes negative and out-of-range indices, so the special coefficient row and
every ordinary Sylvester row use the same proof. Consequently
`coeffMinorAt_addMul` proves the column-operation form of Brown--Traub equation
(18): the original minor is the `G, H` minor times only the usual block-swap
sign.

The retained formal degree is then collapsed internally, without changing the
coefficient-matrix representation. `SubresultantMinor.det_firstRow` expands a
matrix whose first row is supported only in its first column.
`coeffMinorAt_succRight` identifies the remaining first minor with the matrix
whose right formal degree is one lower, so each removed degree contributes one
copy of `lc(G)`; `coeffMinorAt_raiseRight` iterates this to the full power.
The edge case has a one-entry special row rather than another leading
coefficient: `coeffMinorAt_rightDegree` and `poly_rightDegree` prove
`S_deg(H)(G,H) = lc(H)^(deg G - deg H - 1) H`.

Combining the column operation, formal-degree collapse, and edge
factorization gives the scalar and polynomial forms of Brown--Traub Lemma 1:
`coeffMinorAt_brownTraub`, `poly_brownTraub`, and
`poly_brownTraub_rightDegree`. The final scalar contains the block-swap sign,
`lc(G)^(deg F - deg H)`, and
`lc(H)^(deg G - deg H - 1)`. In a lawful exact-division domain,
`divScalar_brownTraub` immediately turns this factorization into an exact
coefficientwise quotient.

The executable specialization is split into two further polynomial identities.
`poly_prem` identifies `S_(deg G - 1)(F,G)` with the signed
pseudo-remainder, including defective degree drops. `poly_descent` transports
the entire lower subresultant family across any nonzero scaled
pseudo-remainder while leaving all factors cross-multiplied. In
`Subresultant.lean`, `BrownInv` (public since the extended chain's cofactor
development consumes it) states that every generalized
subresultant of the current adjacent pair is an explicit scalar multiple of
the corresponding original-pair subresultant. Its initialization, scale,
factor, and step lemmas identify each `hCurr`, prove both exact Brown
divisions, cancel the alternating signs, and preserve the family through the
recursive call. Fuel induction then proves `subresultantOrdered_brownLaw`, so
the valid run cannot take either executable junk exit.

The Mathlib-free fraction field and its dense-polynomial embedding remain
available as general proof infrastructure. Their map and pullback theorems
preserve normalized size, leading coefficients, ring operations,
pseudo-division, and generalized subresultants, but the Brown recurrence proof
does not depend on that detour.

## Ordered Brown run

For nonzero `G₁, G₂` with `deg G₁ ≥ deg G₂`, write `nᵢ = deg Gᵢ`,
`gᵢ = lc(Gᵢ)`, and `prem A B = (pseudoDivMod A B).2`. The internal
worker returns the pair `(chain, hFinal)`. It initializes

```text
δ₁ := n₁ - n₂
h₂ := powNat g₂ δ₁
p := prem G₁ G₂

if p = 0:
  return (#[G₁, G₂], h₂)

G₃ := scale ((-1)^(δ₁ + 1)) p
state := (#[G₁, G₂, G₃], G₂, G₃, h₂)
```

Each loop state contains nonzero adjacent terms `prev = Gᵢ₋₁`, `curr =
Gᵢ`, and `hPrev = hᵢ₋₁`. One step is exactly

```text
δ := deg prev - deg curr
hCurr := divExp (lc curr) hPrev δ
p := prem prev curr

if p = 0:
  return (chain, hCurr)

divisor := (-1)^(δ + 1) * lc(prev) * powNat hPrev δ
next := divScalar p divisor

continue with (chain.push next, curr, next, hCurr)
```

Thus `hCurr = lc(curr)^δ / hPrev^(δ-1)`, and `next` is the
coefficientwise exact quotient of `prem prev curr` by
`(-1)^(δ+1) * lc(prev) * hPrev^δ`. Both divisions are exact and their
denominators are nonzero over an exact-division domain. These signs and powers
are part of the API contract; there is no later unpinned correction.

The executable recurrence calls the proved runtime twins `scaleImpl` and
`divScalarImpl`; `@[csimp]` correspondence theorems identify them with the
list-facing specifications above. Its two fuel/junk exits are deterministic:
fuel exhaustion returns the current `(chain, hPrev)`, while an unexpectedly
zero `next` returns `(chain, hCurr)` without storing that zero. Neither branch
is compatible with the exactness and nonzero obligations recorded by
`BrownLaw`; `subresultantOrdered_brownLaw` establishes that law for the initial
ordered state. The reference `divScalar` in the law is identified with the
worker's `divScalarImpl` by its correspondence theorem. The structural
guarantees below remain independently useful and do not depend on `BrownLaw`.

The public chain stores exactly Brown's nonzero `G₁, …, Gₖ`. It does not
store the generated terminal zero, gap zeros from defective subresultants, the
auxiliary `Hᵢ`, or the scalars `hᵢ`. Termination means
`prem Gₖ₋₁ Gₖ = 0`.

The structural API certifies this representation independently of the value
correspondence: every stored term is nonzero, adjacent sizes strictly decrease
after the first two entries, and the chain length is at most
`min(deg f, deg g) + 2` for nonzero inputs. The worker's public
`g.size + 1` budget is stable: adding arbitrary extra fuel does not change an
ordered run. These facts follow from the explicit zero guards together with the
pseudo-remainder bound and the fact that coefficientwise scaling and division
cannot increase dense size.

### Defective degree drops

Degrees strictly decrease after `G₂`. A drop `δ > 1` is retained as one
step. The new `Gᵢ` is the subresultant at the previous degree minus one even
when its actual degree is lower. Subresultants at the intervening degrees are
zero; the lower endpoint `Hᵢ` is a scalar multiple of `Gᵢ`, with leading
coefficient `hᵢ`. None of those implicit values is inserted into the public
chain, but `hᵢ` remains in the worker state because it determines both the
next exact divisor and the final resultant.

### Terminal value and input order

For an ordered nonzero run ending in `(#[G₁, …, Gₖ], hₖ)`, the resultant
is `hₖ` if `Gₖ` has degree zero and `0` otherwise. In particular, a final
constant `Gₖ` need not itself equal the resultant. The theorem
`resultantOrdered_eq_coeffMinor` identifies this corrected terminal value
with `Subresultant.coeffMinor 0 0 f g`; a terminal zero pseudo-remainder at a
nonconstant divisor is handled by `coeffMinor_zero_of_prem_zero`. For reversed
nonzero inputs,

```text
resultant f g = (-1)^(deg f * deg g) * resultantOrdered g f.
```

Equivalently, the swap negates exactly when both degrees are odd.
Equal-degree inputs retain caller order; only a strict degree reversal swaps
the arguments, so the tie case does not acquire an extra sign.

The total chain wrapper omits zero inputs:

```text
subresultantChain 0 0 = #[]
subresultantChain f 0 = #[f]    when f ≠ 0
subresultantChain 0 g = #[g]    when g ≠ 0
```

For two reversed nonzero inputs it starts with the degree-ordered pair. The
resultant handles zero inputs before the run, using default formal degrees:

```text
resultant f 0 = if f.size ≤ 1 then 1 else 0
resultant 0 g = if g.size ≤ 1 then 1 else 0
resultant (C a) (C b) = 1
resultant f (C c) = c ^ (f.degree?.getD 0)
resultant (C c) g = c ^ (g.degree?.getD 0)
```

Consequently `resultant 0 0 = 1`. These conventions agree with the pinned
Mathlib determinant resultant and its `0^0 = 1` behavior.

Finally, `disc f = 1` whenever `f.size ≤ 1`. For positive degree `n`, let
`d = f.derivative` and `gap = n - 1 - d.degree?.getD 0`. The default-degree
resultant is promoted to derivative formal degree `n - 1` by
`powNat f.leadingCoeff gap * resultant f d` before taking the signed exact
quotient by `lc(f)`. This correction is essential in positive characteristic,
where the derivative's actual degree can fall below `n - 1`; with it the
quotient is exact over every stated exact-division domain.

## Downstream contracts

The extended chain `subresultantChainExt` (Bezout cofactors for every stored
Brown entry) is delivered in `SubresultantExt.lean`:
`subresultantChainExt_law` packages the Bezout and exactness laws,
`subresultantChainExt_values` projects the stored values onto
`subresultantChain`, and the determinantal cofactor development lives in
`SubresultantCofactor.lean`. `hex-poly-z-gcd` reads the terminal entry for
its `CoprimeWitness.constant` route and `hex-mv-gcd` for its `splitBezout`
constructor. It does not alter the resultant or discriminant contracts.

  They are Mathlib-free, per
  [SPEC/benchmarking.md](../../SPEC/benchmarking.md). Mathlib's
  `Polynomial.resultant` is noncomputable, so it is not an in-process
  comparator. The informational external comparator is
  [FLINT](https://flintlib.org/) `fmpz_poly.resultant` and
  `fmpz_poly.discriminant`, called through python-flint's persistent-process
  interface on every rung of the equal-degree bounded-dense input ladder. It
  covers `runResultant` and `runDisc`. The `runChain` and `runPseudoDiv`
  targets declare **no-comparable-surface-in-named-comparator**: python-flint
  exposes neither a subresultant chain nor pseudo-division on `fmpz_poly`.
  FLINT's modular and asymptotically fast kernels differ structurally from
  Hex's integral Brown recurrence, so its ratios orient the Phase-4 report but
  do not gate it. Exact value cross-checking against both FLINT and PARI
  remains independently covered by the conformance oracle.

## Conformance fixtures

Per [SPEC/testing.md](../../SPEC/testing.md), fixtures are tiered into
`core` / `ci` / `local`:

- *core* (Lean-only):
  - `resultant (X − a) (X − b) = a − b` for small integer `a, b`.
  - `resultant f 1 = 1` for any `f`.
  - `resultant (X² + 1) (X − 1) = 2`, plus a few small
    quadratic-times-linear cases.
  - Total conventions: `resultant 0 0 = 1`, two constants give `1`,
    and a positive-degree polynomial paired with zero gives `0`.
  - `disc (X² + b·X + c) = b² − 4·c` for small `b, c`.
  - `disc 0 = 1` and `disc (C c) = 1`, including nonunit `c`.
  - Common-root cases: `resultant (X − 1) (X² − 1) = 0`,
    `resultant (X² + 1) (X² + 1) = 0`.
  - The defective-drop examples `G₁ = 2X⁴+2X³+X+2`,
    `G₂ = 2X³+1`, whose final chain constant is `4` but resultant is
    `16`, and `G₁ = -X⁴`, `G₂ = 2X³-1`, which exercises both
    nonunit exact divisions and has resultant `-1`.
  - Small generalized-minor pins cover both Sylvester blocks, a repeated-row
    zero above index `J`, degree reversal, equal degrees, regular and defective
    Brown-chain terms, left/right homogeneity, and a bivariate `ZPoly`
    coefficient ring. Direct local-determinant checks cover adjacent swaps,
    swap-sequence parity and action, arbitrary duplicate columns, and arbitrary
    column updates. An equal-degree `H = F + B * G` pin with `J > 0`, odd swap
    parity, and `deg H < deg G` checks the multiplier transformation entrywise
    and then checks equation (18). A second pin drops four retained formal
    degrees, checks the independently distinguishable leading-coefficient
    factor `48`, and divides the endpoint subresultant back to `H`; a smaller
    interior-index pin exercises the polynomial law with `J < deg H`. The local
    Laplace determinant is factorial proof infrastructure, so these checks stay
    deliberately small rather than joining the random degree-10 resultant
    sweep.
  - A bivariate case over `R = ZPoly`, exercising the
    `hex-number-field` instantiation: for example
    `resultant_y (y² − t) (y − t) = t² − t`.
- *ci* (CI, with external oracle when available):
  - 30 random degree-10 pairs with a deterministic seed; oracle from
    python-flint, with cypari2 as a secondary implementation.
- *local* (developer-driven):
  - High-degree resultants, timed against the complexity contract.

External oracles: python-flint (`fmpz_poly.resultant`) and cypari2
(`polresultant`). Sage is not used as an oracle.

## Complexity contract

- `pseudoDivMod` for `f, g` of degrees `n, m` runs in
  `O((n − m + 1) · m)` coefficient operations, the same as schoolbook
  polynomial division.
- For two nonzero inputs, `subresultantChain f g` stores at most
  `min(n, m) + 2` nonzero elements. It performs exactly one fewer
  pseudo-division calls than stored elements, including the final call whose
  zero result is not stored, hence at most `min(n, m) + 1` calls and
  `O(n·m)` coefficient operations total. Zero-input wrappers store at most
  one element and perform no pseudo-division. Over `R = Int`, intermediate coefficients have
  bit-length `O((n+m) · (log(n+m) + log ‖f‖∞ + log ‖g‖∞))`, since
  every chain element's coefficients are (up to sign) minors of the
  Sylvester matrix (the subresultant theorem) and Hadamard's bound
  applies.
- `resultant`, `disc`: dominated by the chain construction.

Sylvester+Bareiss costs `O((n+m)³)` coefficient operations on
intermediate values of the same bit-length, so the subresultant chain
is faster by a factor of roughly `n+m`.
